name: FX_STARTUP_MIGRATION_AUTOMATED_IMPORT_UNDO
type: histogram
description: Where undo of the automatic migration was attempted, indicates to what
  degree we succeeded to undo. 0 means we started to undo, 5 means we bailed out from
  the undo because it was not possible to complete it (there was nothing to undo or
  the user was signed in to sync). All higher values indicate progression through
  the undo sequence, with 30 indicating we finished the undo without exceptions in
  the middle.
