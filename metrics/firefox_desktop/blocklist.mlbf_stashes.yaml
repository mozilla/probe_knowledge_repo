description: 'Keep track of whether the bloomfilter-based blocklist engine uses stashes
  from the addons-bloomfilters collection, together with an infrequently updated base
  bloomfilter. If false, the latest (full) bloom filter is downloaded on every update
  of the addon blocklist. This metric is only meaningful if mlbf_enabled is true.
