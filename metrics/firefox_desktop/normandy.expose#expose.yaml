type: event
description: 'This records an event at the moment the user is exposed to an experiment
  treatment. The event is triggered either by the code checking that a certain experiment
  feature is enabled or when that feature value is used. This is different from enrollment
  or experiment activation because it registers when a user actually gets exposed
  to the experiment feature.
