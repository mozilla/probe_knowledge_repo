type: scalar
description: 'The number of differences between the C based sipcc SDP parser and the
  new rust based rsdparsa SDP parser keyed by predefined names of attributes and values
  that do not match between the sipcc parsing result and the rsdparsa parsing result
  or between the rsdparsa parsing result and the original sdp. This should help to
  improve the new rsdparsa to replace the sipcc parser.
