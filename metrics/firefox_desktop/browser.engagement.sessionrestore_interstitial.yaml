type: scalar
description: 'Whether we show about:sessionrestore or not. Split by key, which indicates
  why we showed the item or not. Specifically, ''deferred_restore'' means we didn''t
  autorestore and thus didn''t show the interstitial; ''autorestore'' indicates we
  autorestored without showing the interstitial. ''shown_old_session'', ''shown_only_about_welcomeback'',
  ''shown_many_crashes'', ''shown_many_crashes_old_session'' all indicate we did show
  the interstitial because of a crash, and the text after ''shown'' indicates what
  secondary reason there was to show this page (as we don''t show it for ''just''
  one crash).
