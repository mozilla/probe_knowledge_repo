name: dom.quota.try.error#error
type: event
description: 'An event recorded on an error of the quota manager or its clients. Since
  errors are usually propagated up the call chain, all such propagation steps are
  recorded for an error. This is only active during specific contexts, in particular
  during storage initialization. No dynamic data is included in the event beyond the
  error code which will be added through Bug 1670555.
