name: SANDBOX_REJECTED_SYSCALLS
type: histogram
description: System calls blocked by a seccomp-bpf sandbox policy; limited to syscalls
  where we would crash on Nightly.  The key is generally the architecture and syscall
  ID but in some cases we include non-personally-identifying information from the
  syscall arguments; see the function SubmitToTelemetry in security/sandbox/linux/reporter/SandboxReporter.cpp
  for details.
