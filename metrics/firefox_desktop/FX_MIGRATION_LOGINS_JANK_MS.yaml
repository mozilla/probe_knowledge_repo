type: histogram
description: Accumulated timer delay (variance between when the timer was expected
  to fire and when it actually fired) in milliseconds as an indicator for decreased
  main-thread responsiveness while importing logins / passwords from another browser,
  keyed by the name of the browser (see gAvailableMigratorKeys in MigrationUtils.jsm).
  The import is happening on a background thread and should ideally not affect the
  UI noticeably.
