  service worker provides a response. This includes: possible SW startup, worker thread
  dispatch, time until the respondWith() promise resolves, time to synthesize the
  response (including the body), worker thread to main thread dispatch. In the future
  this should include the IPC roundtrips involved in fetch interception.'
