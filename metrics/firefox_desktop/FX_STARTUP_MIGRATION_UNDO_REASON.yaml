  means we used undo, 1 means the user signed in to sync, 2 means the user created/modified
  a password, 3 means the user created/modified a bookmark (item or folder), 4 means
  we showed an undo option repeatedly and the user did not use it, 5 means we showed
  an undo option and the user actively elected to keep the data. The whole thing is
  keyed to the identifiers of different browsers (so ''chrome'', ''ie'', ''edge'',
  ''safari'', etc.).'
