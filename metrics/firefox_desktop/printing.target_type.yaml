type: scalar
description: 'A counter incremented every time the user prints to a certain target
  type.  The ''pdf_unknown'' count is for printers with names that we don''t know
  about/check for, but that have ''pdf'' in their name, and is mainly a sanity check
  that we''re not missing significant counts in ''pdf_file''. For the most part, the
  ''unknown'' count will be prints to a physical printer, but we can''t know for sure
  since third party drivers could also be print to file drivers that we don''t otherwise
  catch in the other counts.
