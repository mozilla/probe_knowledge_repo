name: MEMORY_DISTRIBUTION_AMONG_CONTENT
type: histogram
description: 'Absolute difference of each content process'' USS and the mean of USS''s,
  normalized by the mean, in percentage. It will be recorded with the rest of the
  memory probes when gatherMemory is called, if at least 2 content processes are alive.
  Example: in case of 4 content processes with USS''s: 1G, 500MB, 1G, 1.5G, the reported
  numbers will be: 0, 50, 0, 50. Which indicates that 2 processes used 50% more or
  50% less memory than the avarage and 2 used exactly as much as the avarage.'
