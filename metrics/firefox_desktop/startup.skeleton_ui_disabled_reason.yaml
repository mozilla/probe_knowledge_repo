description: "The reason why the skeleton UI was not shown to the user. This should\
  \ be one of the following values:\n  None:\n    There was no reason for not showing\
  \ the skeleton UI. This should not\n    be recorded.\n  Ineligible:\n    The user\
  \ was ineligible for the skeleton UI due to information which\n    should already\
  \ be trivially available via telemetry (i.e., the user\n    is running an OS version\
  \ that doesn't support the skeleton UI.)\n  Disabled:\n    The registry specified\
  \ \"Enabled\" as 0 for the skeleton UI.\n  EnabledKeyDoesNotExist:\n    The \"Enabled\"\
  \ key in the registry does not exist.\n  OOM:\n    We encountered an allocation\
  \ failure while trying to show the\n    skeleton UI.\n  Cmdline:\n    The skeleton\
  \ UI was disabled due to the presence of an unsupported\n    command line argument.\n\
  \  EnvVars:\n    The skeleton UI was disabled due to an explicitly unsupported\n\
  \    environment variable.\n  FailedToOpenRegistryKey:\n    We were unable to open\
  \ the skeleton UI Windows registry key.\n  RegistryError:\n    We encountered an\
  \ error trying to read/write a skeleton UI registry\n    value.\n  FailedLoadingDynamicProcs:\n\
  \    We were unable to dynamically load one of the functions we require in\n   \
  \ order to show the skeleton UI.\n  FailedGettingLock:\n    We were unable to acquire\
  \ the skeleton UI lock - this should mean\n    that an existing instance of the\
  \ application is already running.\n  FilesystemFailure:\n    Encountered some error\
  \ getting the path to a file or reading from a\n    particular file while trying\
  \ to show the skeleton UI.\n  NoStartWithLastProfile:\n    The user has set up their\
  \ profiles so Firefox always shows the\n    profile manager during startup.\n  FailedRegisteringWindowClass:\n\
  \    We failed to register the window class needed to show the skeleton UI\n   \
  \ window.\n  CorruptData:\n    Clearly invalid data was found when trying to load\
  \ the necessary\n    information to show the skeleton UI in the right place.\n \
  \ BadWindowDimensions:\n    Window dimensions outside of the supported size for\
  \ the skeleton UI.\n  FailedGettingMonitorInfo:\n    Couldn't get the monitor information\
  \ when trying to display the\n    skeleton UI.\n  CreateWindowFailed:\n    The call\
  \ to CreateWindow failed.\n  FailedGettingDC:\n    We failed to get the HDC to draw\
  \ into.\n  FailedBlitting:\n    We failed blitting the actual skeleton UI to the\
  \ HDC.\n  FailedFillingBottomRect:\n    We failed filling the solid color of the\
  \ main browser below the\n    browser chrome.\n  CrashedOnce:\n    At some point\
  \ the skeleton UI crashed, so we've disabled it for the\n    user.\n  Unknown:\n\
  \    An unknown error occurred - this generally should not happen.\n"
