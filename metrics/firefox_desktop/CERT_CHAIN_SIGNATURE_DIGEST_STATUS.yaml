description: 'Information on weak signature digest algorithms in the chain: 1 = Only
  good algorithms, 2 = a weak algorithm was present in an end entity, 3 = a weak algorithm
  was present in a CA cert, 4 = a weak algorithm was present in both EE and CA certs,
  5 = another error prevented signature algorithm from being determined'
