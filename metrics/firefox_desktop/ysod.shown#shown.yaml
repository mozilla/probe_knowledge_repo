name: ysod.shown#shown
type: event
description: This event is recorded only for Firefox UI documents (chrome). Recorded
  when a Yellow Screen of Death is shown. The `value` is a url on which the error
  happened. Yellow Screen of Death happens when XML or XHTML document encounters a
  parsing error. It is commonly a result of the document being malformed or missing
  DTD entity. Mozilla has a number of documents that rely on DTD entities for localization,
  and in some error scenarios those entities may be missing or malformed themselves,
  in which case the user will see a broken UI.
