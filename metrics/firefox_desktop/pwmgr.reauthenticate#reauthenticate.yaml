  \ be used when the feature is enabled but no prompt is given to the user because\
  \ they have recently authenticated.\n  \"success_disabled\" is used when the feature\
  \ is disabled.\n  \"success_unsupported_platform\" should be set when the user attempts\
  \ to authenticate on an unsupported platform.\n  \"success_no_password\" should\
