description: 'If a BITS download fails on the Windows side (that is to say, BITS ecounters
  an error rather than Firefox failing to interact with BITS), it will likely give
  an hresult error indicating what happened. This probe reports those error codes
  to allow us to see if BITS is commonly failing on some systems. This probe is keyed
  on the type of update download, either "PARTIAL" or "COMPLETE".
