type: counter
description: 'A counter that indicates how many NORMAL tabs a user has open. This

  value will only be set if the user has at least *one* open tab. If they

  have 0, this ping will not get sent, resulting in a null value. To

  disambiguate between a failed `tabs_open_count` ping and 0 open tabs,

  please see `has_open_tabs`.
