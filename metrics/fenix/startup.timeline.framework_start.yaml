description: 'The duration the Android framework takes to start before letting us
  run

  code in `*Application.init`. This is calculated from `appInitTimestamp -

  processStartTimestamp`. `processStartTimestamp` is derived from the clock

  tick time unit, which is expected to be less granular than nanoseconds.

  Therefore, we convert and round our timestamps to clock ticks before

  computing the difference and convert back to nanoseconds to report.


  For debugging purposes, `clock_ticks_per_second`, which may vary between

  devices, is also reported as a metric
