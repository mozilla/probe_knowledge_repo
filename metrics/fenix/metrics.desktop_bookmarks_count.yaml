description: 'A counter that indicates how many bookmarks a user has in the desktop

  folder. This value will only be set if the user has at least *one*

  bookmark. If they have 0, this ping will not get sent, resulting in a

  null value. To disambiguate between a failed `desktop_bookmarks_count`

  ping and 0 bookmarks, please see `has_desktop_bookmarks`.
