description: "The system received an Intent for the HomeActivity. An intent\nis received\
  \ an external entity wants to the app to display\ncontent. Intents can be received\
  \ when the app is closed \u2013 at\nwhich point the app will be opened \u2013 or\
  \ when the app is\nalready opened \u2013 at which point the already open app will\
  \ make\nchanges such as loading a url. This can be used loosely as a\nheuristic\
  \ for when the user requested to open the app. The\nHomeActivity encompasses the\
  \ home screen and browser screen but\nmay include other screens. This differs from\
  \ the app_opened\nprobe because it measures all startups, not just cold startup.\n"
