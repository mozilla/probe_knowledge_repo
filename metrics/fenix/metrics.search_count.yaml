name: metrics.search_count
type: labeled_counter
description: 'The labels for this counter are `<search-engine-name>.<source>`.


  If the search engine is bundled with Fenix `search-engine-name` will be

  the name of the search engine. If it''s a custom search engine (defined:

  https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/1607) the value will be

  `custom`.


  `source` will be: `action`, `suggestion`, `widget` or `shortcut`

  (depending on the source from which the search started). Also added the

  `other` option for the source but it should never enter on this case.
