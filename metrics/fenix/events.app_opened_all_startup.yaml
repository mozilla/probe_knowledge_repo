name: events.app_opened_all_startup
type: event
description: 'A user opened the app to the HomeActivity. The HomeActivity

  encompasses the home screen, browser screen, settings screen,

  collections and other screens in the nav_graph.

  This differs from the app_opened probe because it measures all

  startups, not just cold startup. Note: There is a short gap

  between the time application goes into background and the time

  android reports the application going into the background.

  Note: This metric does not record souce when app opened from

  task switcher: open application -> press home button -> open

  recent tasks -> choose fenix. In this case will report

  [source = unknown, type = hot, has_saved_instance_state = false].
