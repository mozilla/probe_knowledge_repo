name: storage.stats.data_dir_bytes
type: memory_distribution
description: 'The size of all data minus `cache_bytes`. This is the output of [StorageStats.getDataBytes](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/usage/StorageStats#getDataBytes())
  except we subtract the value of `cache_bytes` so the cache is not measured redundantly;
  see that method for details. This value is only available on Android 8+.
