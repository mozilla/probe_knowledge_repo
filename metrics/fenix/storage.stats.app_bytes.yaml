description: 'The size of the app''s APK and related files as installed: this is expected
  to be larger than download size. This is the output of [StorageStats.getAppBytes](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/usage/StorageStats#getAppBytes())
  so see that for details. This value is only available on Android 8+. A similar value
  may be available on the Google Play dashboard: we can use this value to see if that
  value is reliable enough.
