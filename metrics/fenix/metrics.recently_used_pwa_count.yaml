name: metrics.recently_used_pwa_count
type: counter
description: 'A counter that indicates how many PWAs a user has recently used.

  Threshold for "recency" set in HomeActivity#PWA_RECENTLY_USED_THRESHOLD.

  Currently we are not told by the OS when a PWA is removed by the user,

  so we use the "recently used" heuristic to judge how many PWAs are still

  active, as a proxy for "installed". This value will only be set if the

  user has at least *one* recently used PWA. If they have 0, this metric

  will not be sent, resulting in a null value during analysis on the

  server-side. To disambiguate between a failed `recently_used_pwa_count`

  metric and 0 recent PWAs, please see `has_recent_pwas`.
