name: experiments.metrics.active_experiment
type: string
description: 'Records the branch name of the active experiment, if the client is enrolled
  in the `fenix-test-2019-08-05` experiment. This is intended to validate that the
  service-experiments library properly matches clients to experiments and can take
  action based on a multi-branched experiment. This is done by recording the experiment
  branch name in this string metric which allows the experiment to be transparent
  and unobtrusive to the user.
